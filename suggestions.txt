Detailed Suggestions for Improvements:

1. Imports and Organization:
   - Group and sort imports (standard library, third-party, local).
   - Add a module-level docstring to clearly articulate the purpose of this test suite.

2. Test Case Naming and Granularity:
   - Consider splitting tests into multiple TestCase classes if the suite grows (e.g., separate tests for initialization, file operations, AI, etc.).
   - Use descriptive names for test methods to communicate what each test is validating.

3. Code Duplication and Profiling:
   - The profiling boilerplate (cProfile enable/disable and printing stats) is repeated across tests. Abstract this into a helper function to reduce duplication and increase consistency.

4. Asynchronous Testing:
   - Tests currently use `asyncio.run` to run async functions. For improved clarity, consider using an async test framework such as pytest-asyncio, or provide a helper function to run async operations more fluently.

5. Mocking and Assertions:
   - Review the placement of patches. Confirm that each patch is applied in the correct scope to avoid interference between tests.
   - Beyond checking that mocks are called, add assertions to validate intermediate state changes when applicable.

6. Performance Testing Considerations:
   - While profiling is useful for performance insights, these tests can be system-dependent. Optionally, move performance tests into a separate suite that can be run as a performance benchmark rather than part of the standard unit tests.

7. UI Resizing Logic:
   - Consider abstracting the resizing calculations into a separate function so that both logic unit tests and UI integration tests can reuse the same computation logic, thereby reducing redundancy.

8. Error Handling and Edge Cases:
   - Add tests for failure scenarios (e.g., app initialization failures, file not found, etc.) to ensure robust handling.

9. State Isolation and Clean-up:
   - Ensure that changes to global state (like modifications to `sys.path` or file I/O mocks) are reverted after tests, to avoid side effects in other tests.

10. Improving Comments and Readability:
    - Use inline comments judiciously, explaining the intent behind skipping UI operations or altering internal behavior.
    - Remove or update comments that refer to deprecated logic or temporarily disabled operations.

Overall, the code is functional and leverages mocking effectively, but making these improvements would improve maintainability, clarity, and test reliability over time.
